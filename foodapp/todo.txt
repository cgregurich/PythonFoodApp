URGENT!!!
learn to write tests.
I changed fooditem.proportionalize parameter from ratio to amount (why not calculate the ratio within the func?)
and i have no idea what I broke because of it. Learn to write tests, they will make life much easier!!


*Change DAO module to FoodDao class, because I'll need to implement more data access objects
such as meals and meal plans, groceries maybe, etc.

Meal:
    ability to view meal, modify meal, etc

MealPlan:
    implement the class and all that

make these things usable throught the TUI

implement meal plan TUI
create a "main" tui that you can choose to interact with food db (i.e. macros sheet) or meal db (need to make; i.e. sheet1)
groceries come later, booter sket

MEAL PLAN DISPLAY
meal name and macros
eg:

NAME      CAL    CARB    FAT    PROTEIN
Breakast  1000   100     20     30

INDIVIDUAL MEAL DISPLAY
meal name as header
each ingredient with normal food_item display

eg:

BREAKFAST

NAME  SS  UNIT   CAL    CARB   FAT   PROTEIN
oats  125  g     375    20     4      4
egg   6    egg   420    0      20     30
